## Memory Usage Monitored by `process.py`


`process.py` is a RSS monitor that runs in a seperate thread and reports the RSS at regular intervals.

### cPyMemTrace No Events Computed, No Events Logged

This was to establish the overhead of calling `trace_or_profile_function()` but merely incrementing the event counter. Nothing is calculated. Nothing is logged.

Output in `tmp/LAS/cPyMemTrace/LASToHtml_trace_C/LASToHTML.log`. Time was 29.346 s, x1.137

`process.py` at 1.0s interval:

</center>


### cPyMemTrace RSS Only Computed, No Events Logged

This was to establish the overhead of calling `trace_or_profile_function()` as before but also computing just the RSS. Nothing is logged.

Output in `tmp/LAS/cPyMemTrace/LASToHtml_trace_D/LASToHTML.log`. Time was 241.212 s, x9.349

`process.py` at 1.0s interval:

</center>


### cPyMemTrace All Events Computed, No Events Logged

This was to establish the overhead of calling `trace_or_profile_function()` and extracting all the log file data but not actually logging any of it.

Output in `tmp/LAS/cPyMemTrace/LASToHtml_trace_B/LASToHTML.log`. Time was 252.640 s, x9.791

### cPyMemTrace All Events Computed, RSS changes >=4096 bytes Logged

This was to establish the overhead of calling `trace_or_profile_function()` and extracting all the log file data but only logging them if the RSS changed by >=Â±4096 bytes (one page).

Output in `tmp/LAS/cPyMemTrace/LASToHtml_trace_E/LASToHTML.log`. Time was 246.278 s, x9.545

There were 138,243,077 events. The log file contained:

Lines: 74,518 (i.e. 1 in 1,855 events)
Words: 670,302
Bytes: 16,393,947
